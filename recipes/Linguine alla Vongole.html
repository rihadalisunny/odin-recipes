    <h2>How to Make Linguine alla Vongole</h2>
    <p>
      This is linguine alla vongole, which is clam spaghetti, but much more fun
      to say. With layers of clam flavor from clam juice, canned clams, and
      freshly steamed clams, and a rich, herbed wine sauce, this dish is
      something truly special.
    </p>

    <h2>Linguine alla Vongole Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>1/4 white onion, minced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
      <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano leaves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 (8 ounce) bottles clam juice</li>
      <li>4 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams, drained, juice reserved</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch, or as needed</li>
      <li>8 ounces linguine pasta</li>
      <li>12 fresh cherrystone or littleneck clams</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make Linguine alla Vongole Step-By-Step</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
      Pour a thin layer of olive oil into a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add
      onions and sauté until soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and
      crushed red pepper, and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
      Pour in white wine, bay leaves, parsley, oregano, thyme, black pepper, and
      salt. Increase heat to bring mixture to a simmer; cook until volume is
      reduced by half.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
      Stir in bottled clam juice, plus clam juice from 3 cans of chopped clams
      (set chopped clams aside to use later in the recipe). Reduce heat to
      medium. Combine clam juice from remaining can of chopped clams with
      cornstarch in a small jar with a tight-fitting lid; place in the
      refrigerator to use later for thickening sauce.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
      Simmer sauce over medium heat, stirring frequently, until it begins to
      have the consistency of a sauce, about 20 minutes.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
      While sauce simmers, cook the pasta: bring a large pot of lightly salted
      water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the
      bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and set aside to keep warm.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>
      While pasta cooks, steam the clams: In a pot with a steamer rack, bring
      water to a boil. Steam whole clams over medium heat, covered, stirring or
      shaking the pot occasionally until they open, 5 to 7 minutes. Set aside.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 7</h4>
    <p>
      Now, pull it all together: add chopped canned clams to sauce; cook just
      until heated, about 3 minutes. If the sauce is still thin, shake the
      refrigerated clam juice-cornstarch slurry, and pour in a little at a time;
      cook and stir until just thick enough–the starch from the linguine will
      also thicken the sauce a little.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 8</h4>
    <p>
      Toss linguine in the pan with clam sauce and coat evenly. Divide linguine
      onto individual plates; divide whole clams on top. Top with Parmesan
      cheese and fresh parsley.
